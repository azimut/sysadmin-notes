- slides: https://www.slideshare.net/Docker/unikernels-the-rise-of-the-library-hypervisor-in-mirageos
- Hypervisors:
  - run full OS emulation
  - sit at the bottom of everything make it hard to compose into the whole architecture.
- Unikernels:
  - OS broken down into individual "libraries" (tcp/ip, device drivers, schedulers)
  - linked by conf file and a bootloader
