  - .dockerignore
    - useful for COPY
    - also when doing a "docker build ." for
      "Sending build context to Docker daemon"
  - COPY when used with directories, it copies the content not the dir
  - $ docker system df
    $ docker system prune
    $ docker system prune --all
  - $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t catscii .
  - removing the "recommended" packages from APT installation makes the build fail
    and start and a goose chase of which package needs to be installed
  - Cache of cargo rust
    #+begin_src dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.rustup \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cargo/registry \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cargo/git \
		--mount=type=cache,target=/app/target \
		set -eux; \
		cargo build --release;
    #+end_src
  - A process running as PID 1 inside a container is treated specially
    by Linux: it ignores any signal with the default action. As a
    result, the process will not terminate on SIGINT or SIGTERM unless
    it is coded to do so.

  - As a hack to enable Ctrl+c to work, we could spawn from /bin/sh
    CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/catscii"]
