  - psad is a collection of three lightweight system daemons (two main
    daemons and one helper daemon) that run on Linux machines and
    analyze iptables log messages to detect port scans and other
    suspicious traffic. A typical deployment is to run psad on the
    iptables firewall where it has the fastest access to log data.
