  - It is simple and does not have as many features as pureftp and proftp.
  - As you can see, ~there is no way for this service to have individual
    permissions~, but when it comes to anonymous settings it is quite
    good. Sometimes it can be nice to have an anonymous ftp server (for
    sharing open source), and vsftpd does a really good job at this.
