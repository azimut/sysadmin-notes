  trees are the directories (subdir or subblobs)
  commits (msg,author,parent commits,tree)
- HEAD is the current commit pointer
- git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline
- git cat-file -p HASH
- git push <remote> <localbranch>:<remotebranch>
** Merge 2 branches
- git checkout -b newbranch
- ...vim, add, commit...
- git checkout master
- git checkout -b otherbranch
- ...vim, add, commit....
- git checkout master
- git merge newbranch
- git merge otherbranch
  - fails so I can git merge --abort OR
  - git mergetool OR
  - vim...git add...git merge --continue
** remote
- git pull == git fetch; git merge
- git push origin master:master
- git branch --set-upstream-to-origin=origin/master
- git branch -vv
