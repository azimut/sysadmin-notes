  - email authentication method
  - to ensure that sender server is authorized to send an email from that domain
  - messaged back if bounced
  - implementation
    - every domain that has an A or MX record should have a DNS's SPF record
    - receivers check DNS's TXT records and act upon his result
    - mail forwarding is NOT allowed by SPF, instead you can
      - remailing: changing the orignal sender
      - refusing: returning "551 user not local; please try <usr@example.com>"
      - allowlisting on the target server
      - SRS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Rewriting_Scheme
    - example: "v=spf1 mx -all"
    - example: "v=spf2 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 a -all"
