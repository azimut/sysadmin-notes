- =Signing=
  - insert one or more ~DKIM-Signature~ header fields
  - Signers can choose which header fields they sign
  - "From:" field must be always signed.
  - a non-existing field matches the empty string,
    so that adding a field with that name will break the signature
  - separeted by (;)

** TODO 22 article | A breakdown of a DKIM replay attack

https://proton.me/blog/dkim-replay-attack-breakdown

- deliver failures from proton to gmail
  - decline reputation in Gmail Postmaster Tools https://www.gmail.com/postmaster/
  - increase sending ~from bad ip addresses~
  - even they were registered as "fully authenticated"

- dkim replay:
  - single spam email originally sent from proton,
  - is resent to many gmail users

- temporary rotated DKIM signing keys to prevent email passing DKIM

** 22 video   | What is DKIM Alignment and why it matters!

https://vimeo.com/697959672

- Tobias Herkula

- IP addresses are no longer a trusting factor on the world today
  - IP blacklists
    - help to get out of botnets,
    - but NOT bad actors on good reputation platforms

- Types of DKIM alignment (from rfc 5322)
  - strict: same From address is on the header and on the signature
  - relaxed: introduced with DMARC standard, a match only on the organization domain (?)

- "recent attacks are not really dkim replay attacks are more a loophole provided by email server providers
   to allow clients to send email immediately"

- abandoned around 19:00

** 23 video   | Understanding DKIM Replay Attacks a must for email senders

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MMt4LmnNJo

- starts 9:15

- forwarding is like replaying it
- all the authentication methods that we have are designed so that forwarding emails is allowed
- it starts by sending 1 message to hijack their reputation, and then replay it from your domain

- The switch from /IP based reputation/ to /DOMAIN based reputation/ caused the increase of these attacks
  - there is no way to keep an ipv6 representation

- Steps
  1) send an email from a legitimate and trustworthy sender TO an email account that you own
  2) take the whole received email (to keep the DKIM signature)
     and re-inject it via SMTP to send to new (many) recipients
  3) mail fails SPF, but should pass DKIM

- Initial Sender Mitigations
  - expiration  : set expiration "x="
  - oversigning : sign headers too, even if they are not used, to make message less maleable
  - resign      : soft bounced emails should be sign again on every delivery attempt

- Receiver Mitigations
  - check and enforce RFC5322 header compliance
  - demand SPF/DKIM alignment
  - check for high inbound peaks
  - count the number of equal inbound DKIM

- no OSS tool to detect DKIM replay attacks
