- [mail] -> MTA -> queue -> MTA (internet)
                         -> MDA (local)

- an MDA is a program that is in charge of:
  1) delivering a email to a local user
  2) reporting to the SMTP server if the deliver was successful or not

- MDA *interface* is /somewhat/ standard
  - reads from ~stdin~
  - reports success or failure through ~exit(3)~ status
    https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=exit&sektion=3&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD+4.3-RELEASE
    https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysexits&manpath=FreeBSD+4.3-RELEASE
  - there is back and forth protocol of any kind

- MDA execution
  - executed /for each mail/ being delivered
  - executed with the /privileges/ of the recipient user

- valid MDA
  #+begin_src sh
    #!/bin/sh
    cat     # consumes stdin, but email content will be gone forever
    exit $? # report cat's exit code
  #+end_src

- MDA environment variables
  - PATH,SHELL,HOME
  |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | LOGNAME   | contain the recipient user (OS user)                      |
  | USER      | "                                                         |
  |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | DOMAIN    | recipient's domain, before aliasing                       |
  | LOCAL     | user part of the recipient email address, before aliasing |
  | RECIPIENT | email address, after aliasing                             |
  | EXTENSION | gilles+1@poolp.org, "1" in this case                      |
  |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | SENDER    | email address OR empty on case of MAILER-DAEMON bounce    |
  |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|

- final script
  #+begin_src sh
    #!/bin/sh
    MAILDIR=${HOME}/Maildir
    umask 077
    mkdir -p ${MAILDIR}/{new,tmp}
    FILENAME=$(date +%s).$(openssl rand -hex 8).$(hostname)
    cat > ${MAILDIR}/tmp/${FILENAME} &&
        mv ${MAILDIR}/tmp/${FILENAME} ${MAILDIR}/new/ # mv is an atomic update
  #+end_src
