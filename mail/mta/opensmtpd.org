- Both server and client side implementations of SMTP
  - server: accept messages coming from the network or local socket and put it to the queue
  - client: taking a message from the queue and forwarding it

- Gilles is the creator of OpenSMTPD

- SMTP
  - is only a way to move mail between machines, is not for retrieve it.
  - relies heavily on the DNS protocol (MX)
  - to goal of a MX is to route msg closer to the destination
  - it only sees 1(one) node ahead
  - RFC imposes responsability over the msgs
    - you are not allowed to lose a msg that you accepted
    - if you can't relay, the sender must be ack
    - each MX has an interest in getting message out of it way fast
    - transactional protocol, accepted message is a commit
