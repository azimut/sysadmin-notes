** 2 Preparing your host and Environment

- System Checklist
  1) Set your ~hostname~ correctly
  2) verify your host's connectivity
  3) maintain a reliable system ~time~
  4) make sure that the ~syslog~ service can record postfix diagnostics
  5) configure name resolution for the client
  6) configure ~DNS~ records for the mail server

- postfix automatically uses the hostname that you
  assign to the server when greeting remote mail clients and servers,
  unless you manually configure another name. (with =myhostname=)

- check FQDN hostname
  $ hostname -f
