* 02 | We can't send mail farther than 500 miles from here

- http://web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/500-miles
  - sendmail.cf
  - SunOS
  - OS was upgraded
  - but sendmail was downgraded (8 -> 5) from a manual 8 upgrade
  - but the "sendmail 8" config was kept, making some variables set to 0(zero)
    - because it didn't had sane? default values
  - among those variables, the timeout, which aborted the connection in 3ms
- https://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail-faq.html
  - signals travel at
    - "3c/4" over copper cable
    - "2c/3" over fiber (slower than copper?)
  - Quote
    #+begin_src
      Sysadmins do that sort of thing all the time. The answer to a
      bug is never "the system has been up too long", but rebooting
      the system is still sometimes the right answer, simply because
      it has the effect of fixing the problem.

      You fix a problem, any way you can, in order to rectify the
      production issue, and then you come back later to try to
      determine what the "right" solution is.

* 21 | Writing a custom Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)

https://poolp.org/posts/2020-12-29/writing-a-custom-mail-delivery-agent/

- [mail] -> MTA -> queue -> MTA (internet)
                         -> MDA (local)

- an MDA is a program that is in charge of:
  1) delivering a email to a local user
  2) reporting to the SMTP server if the deliver was successful or not

- MDA *interface* is /somewhat/ standard
  - reads from ~stdin~
  - reports success or failure through ~exit(3)~ status
    https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=exit&sektion=3&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD+4.3-RELEASE
    https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysexits&manpath=FreeBSD+4.3-RELEASE
  - there is back and forth protocol of any kind

- MDA execution
  - executed /for each mail/ being delivered
  - executed with the /privileges/ of the recipient user

- valid MDA
  #+begin_src sh
    #!/bin/sh
    cat     # consumes stdin, but email content will be gone forever
    exit $? # report cat's exit code
  #+end_src

- MDA environment variables
  - PATH,SHELL,HOME
  |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | LOGNAME   | contain the recipient user (OS user)                      |
  | USER      | "                                                         |
  |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | DOMAIN    | recipient's domain, before aliasing                       |
  | LOCAL     | user part of the recipient email address, before aliasing |
  | RECIPIENT | email address, after aliasing                             |
  | EXTENSION | gilles+1@poolp.org, "1" in this case                      |
  |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | SENDER    | email address OR empty on case of MAILER-DAEMON bounce    |
  |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
