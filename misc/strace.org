    Some new (to me) things I’ve learned from the video:
    --seccomp-bpf to attach a BPF filter to limit ptrace stops to relevant syscalls. And also the limitations and caveats that go with this.
    -k to record stack traces (I’ve used this before but learned some new tricks)
    -y and -yy to print paths, sockets and other information related to file descriptors
    -Y to show command names associated with PIDs, handy when tracing multiple PIDs with -f. There is also an option to show PID namespace mappings.
    -z/-Z to show only successful/failed syscalls
    --trace-fds to limit tracing to selected file descriptors
    --inject to fake errors or return values or arguments --tips to have the ascii ostrich dispense a random tip
