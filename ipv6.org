  on ipv4 there are "honeypot" aka "darknet" aka "telescope" subnetworks that have no legitimate hosts and that can detect mass ipv4 scans
  "a /16 darknet (65,536 IPs) detects one packet from a 10,000 packet per second (pps) random scan in 6.6 seconds."
  on ipv6 a /48 network becomes impossible to detect by the same mean
  so instead we watch for reverse PTR requests as the victims of the scan will eventually try to resolve the ip of the attackers (?
  with that data and heuristics (? we can identify attackers
