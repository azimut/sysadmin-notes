  Function used without declaration assumes dynamic function
    #+begin_src
...the function fmt_array_custom is called without prior declaration. So the compiler implicitly assumes a declaration (non-static).
Later in line 304, it sees the actual function declaration/definition which is static.
This is a conflict.
For fixing this you can add a declaration before line 191. Just copy the function proto-type (without the body) from line 304.
  #+end_src
