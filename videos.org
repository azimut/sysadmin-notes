** Hardware

- Cat6 Ethernet Cable

- Wifi Bridge:
  - GL.iNet GL-MT1300 / GL AR750S

- Managed Switch:
  - Tp-LInk TL-SG105E
  - Must have ~port mirroring~

- Onion Server (close to minimum)
  - Dell Optiplex 9020
  - Quad Core i5 4570
  - 32GB RAM
  - 2TB HDD (not SSD)
  - PCI Extra network adaptor
    - Make sure is older than Security Onion's Linux kernel

** Building the network

- Managed Switch
  - will get assigned an IP
  - one port will be setup as mirroring
  - other ports can be limited in speed to avoid congestion on mirror

- Bridge router
  - switch it to "access point" mode
  - this might not need bridge necesarilly

** Setting up and deploying Security Onion

- gpg4win
  - Kleopatra is the name of its GUI
  - should return "the data could not be verified",
    because the .key downloaded is not trusted by anyone (?
  - instead compare the "audit log" on Kleopatra

- balena etcher
  - Windows will ask permission for "Window Command Processor" to run

- UEFI
  - usually you need do these changes to be able to change the boot sequence
    - disable "secure boot"
    - enable legacy option ROMs
  - To power on after a power outage occurs:
    Power Management > AC Recovery > Power On

- "Standalone installation" type
- "Standard" network installation (not airgap)
- Automatic updates installations (updates non security onion software)
- Choose ~zeek~ (formerly Bro) to generate metadata instead of going for ~suricata~ for both metadata and NIDS alerts
- Select ETOPEN (Emerging Threats Open) for the IDS ruleset
- Keep the additional services on

$ sudo yum update
$ sudo soup       # Security Onion UPdated
$ ssh onion-host
$ sudo so-status
